# Tircown's Filament_motion_sensor tweak

Original design is here: <https://github.com/Tircown/VoronFrenchUsers/tree/main/Mod/Filament_motion_sensor>

- M1: mounting side 1
- M2: mounting side 2
- 1C: 1 tube fitting
- 2C: 2 tube fitting

- M1-1C configuration is the closest to the original.
- M2-2C is the one I use.

Why?
I wanted suppot of PTFE fitting on both side. Then I designed for 2 sides (2C configuration).
I also made adjustement for:

- Sensor enclosing
- Overhangs
- ...
